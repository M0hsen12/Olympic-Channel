# Android Coding Challenge
hello
first of all thx for opportunity u guys giving me.all
on start of any project i get piece of paper and pen i start writing a something like road map , thing i should do first and
which library should i use on this project ,i gonna point this out an, when a new tech or usefull  new library comes
and i will learn it. i love learning new staff, so i have to choose which tech to use, so for this code challenge

## for multithreading
we have two option rx-java and coroutine , i decide to use because both are very handy ,easy to use and too many api to use
im comfortable with both and of course both have their cons and advantages ,
for API calls i used rx java
for interacting with database i used coroutine

## architecture and design pattern
iam comfortable with Clean architecture, MVVM , MVI  but for this project
i decide to go with MVVM , for me MVVM is best and its Easy to implement,
we only need to handle 3 major component (Model , View ,ViewModel)
i didnt use Clean architecture because it generate lot more code and im was on our new year holidays
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nowruz
we have two week holidays and it started 22 march and i was on vacation when me and Lluis talked(interview),
and i start coding 3th april ,so i felt if i go clean architecture i may rush thing and left some thing out,
even now using MVVM i have very little time for test ,lets hope every thing went well...

but if i have enough time  i would use both Clean architecture and MVVM ,  basically in clean architecture`s
presentation layer we can use any design pattern we want , including MVVM , MVI , MVP and so on

##dependency injection
basically we have two major di library dagger2.0 and hilt
dagger is here for long time and passed its test  in very aspect first choice for every one ,
but hilt on other hand is new compare to dagger and Hilt is built on top of the Dagger and using it feel like cheating :))
its very easy just need some annotation , i choose dagger because i felt like i should use original library
and more use to working with dagger than hilt.

##database
well we got load of option but Room persistence is best in every way and its google`s library ,Room is a officialORM library by Android 
i could use green db or realm or sqlite itself but i decide to go room its easy to use and light wight library


##unit test
im comfortable with junit test 4 and 5 and espresso and mockito but sadly for reason i wrote above i start code very  late.
im so sry that i could not write test for project but definitely im good with test 

and on other staff,its just usual suspect 
for api cal i used retrofit
for loading image i used glide
